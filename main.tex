\noindent
Traditional supply chain models in the agricultural and food sectors frequently struggle with issues of lack of 
transparency, interoperability, and traceability, resulting in erroneous reporting and problems with quality assurance. The 
management and optimization of supply chains, however, have the potential to revolutionize with the introduction of disruptive 
technologies like blockchain and machine learning (ML).In this regard, the proposed project ``Enhancing Trust and Traceability in 
Supply Chains through Blockchain and Machine Learning" offers an all-encompassing solution that makes use of the immutability 
and transparency of blockchain technology as well as the analytical power of ML algorithms to enhance traceability, transparency, 
and sustainability in the agriculture and food supply chains. The project seeks to monitor a product's complete life cycle, from 
production and harvesting to processing, packaging, and distribution. utilizing a decentralized and secure blockchain network, more 
especially Hyperledger Fabric, for storage and delivery. This makes it possible to track and document each transaction and activity 
in the supply chain effectively, removing middlemen and streamlining the procedure for reduced costs and increased efficiency.
\par The project also seeks to advance sustainable agriculture and food supply chain practices. Customers can make informed 
decisions by receiving clear information regarding farming practices. Customers can choose products that suit their interests for 
those that are socially and environmentally responsible.

\centerline{\LARGE \textit{{Study Limitations and Scope for Future Work}}}
% \vspace{3em}
% Like any other study, this study is also not without limitations due to shortage of resources and field setting. The study limitations and future research scopes are presented below.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The pedestrians' road crossing behaviour was observed only during non-peak hours (11 am to 2 pm) to avoid the influence of traffic police (forcibly stopping pedestrian from signal violation). Thus, future research should include both peak and non-peak hours to study pedestrians' unsafe road crossing behaviour. 
    
%     \item In signal violation research social and non-social factors were studied on one-way crosswalks. In future research the same approach could be extended to two-way crosswalks.
    
%     \item Research involving the interaction between variables (demographics of leader and follower pedestrian violating signal) could help in better understanding the pedestrian signal violation risk-taking behaviour.
    
%     \item The current study did not account for the driver's behaviour such as yielding behaviour, speeding and rush driving into consideration. Future research involving these explanatory variables can provide better insight into pedestrian risk-taking behaviour.
    
%     \item To get an initial understanding of pedestrian distracted road crossing behaviour in developing countries like India, similar to past studies, the present study also considered crosswalks with one step crossing (three one-way crosswalks). The current study methodology can be extended to two-way divided streets in terms of two-step crossing to understand more complex crossing behaviour, where pedestrians could use mobile phones in the first step of crossing (start to median) and might not use on the second step (median to end) or vice-versa. 
    
%      \item Future research should also investigate how pedestrians utilise their hearing senses to perceive their environments (especially pedestrians who are holding the phone or texting and not wearing headphones). This would provide a better understanding of how situational awareness is reduced by mobile phone use or if pedestrians are relying on senses other than sight to inform them of traffic conditions.
    
%     \item The current distraction study only measured influence of various distractors in road crossing behaviour. In future research, distracted unsafe road crossing behavioural estimates could be incorporated with Level of Service measure to identify unsafe signalized intersection crosswalks.
    
%     \item Combining objective observational data (on all stages of pedestrian road crossing) with subjective data (questionnaire survey) from the same observed pedestrian would provide a better understanding of human factors involved in crossing behaviour at signalised intersection crosswalks. 
    
    
%     \item The observations under the current study were made only based on one city level data, which may restrict the scope of the conclusions drawn from the current study. Thus, future studies need to extend the methodology to  a wider variety of intersections, and samples with a more diverse category of signalised and unsignalised intersections over different Indian provinces (commercial, residential, and educational) to make findings more generalised.
% \end{itemize}

% Although there are several possibilities for future research in this domain, the results obtained from this study can be of great help for researchers, policymakers, design practitioners, and engineers. These findings will also be useful for designing better interventions and reducing unsafe crossing behaviour.
