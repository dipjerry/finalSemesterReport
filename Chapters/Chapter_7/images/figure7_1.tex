      \item Each row in the table represents a specific product and contains several columns.
      \item The columns include the product ID and the parties involved in the supply chain, such as farmers, exporters, importers, logistic providers, and retailers.
      \item There are also columns labeled "test," "label," and "view."
   \end{itemize}
   \item Dynamic Content and Interactions:
   \begin{itemize}

\item The content in the columns of the table dynamically changes based on the product's status and role within the supply chain.
\item Different labels or status indicators, such as "Completed," "Processing," or "Not Available," are displayed to represent the current stage or availability of the product at each role.
\item Users can interact with the table by clicking on specific elements.
\item For example, clicking on the "View" column triggers an action to view more detailed information about the selected product.
\end{itemize}
