The create user process initiated by admin involves registering a new user while incorporating the Certificate Authority (CA) authority and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. During registration, the user provides essential information such as name, email, user type, address, password, and profile picture. The information is validated for accuracy and completeness, and a unique user ID is generated. The user's identity is verified by the CA, which issues a digital certificate, establishing their authenticity within the network. Additionally, KYC procedures may be implemented, requiring users to submit identification documents and undergo verification to ensure compliance and mitigate fraud risks. By integrating CA authority and KYC procedures, the create user process enhances the trust, security, and regulatory compliance within the Hyperledger network.
