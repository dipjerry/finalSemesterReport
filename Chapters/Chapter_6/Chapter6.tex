\section{Introduction}
During the implementation phase, we, as a team, focused on translating the design and requirements into a functional and robust system. This phase involved the actual development and deployment of the supply chain management solution using blockchain technology. We encountered various challenges along the way, but through collaboration and perseverance, we were able to overcome them and achieve successful results.
\par One of the key aspects of the implementation was the adoption of a microservice architecture using Docker. This allowed us to modularize the system and deploy different components in separate Docker containers. By leveraging Docker, we ensured scalability, flexibility, and portability of our solution. Each organization in the network, including peers and orderers, was hosted within its own Docker container, providing an isolated and consistent environment for running the Hyperledger Fabric nodes.
\par The Hyperledger Fabric framework served as the foundation for our blockchain implementation. It provided us with the necessary tools and protocols for building a secure and decentralized supply chain management system. By leveraging the features of Hyperledger Fabric, such as smart contracts and consensus mechanisms, we were able to create a transparent and tamper-proof ledger for tracking and verifying supply chain transactions.
