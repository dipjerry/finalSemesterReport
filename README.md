Dr. Rahul Raoniar modified the template to fulfill the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay M.Tech students' credit seminar report requirements.

Sugeet Sunder prepared the earlier version of this template. The style was initially created by Steve R. Gunn and modified into a template for IIT Kanpur by Sunil Patel and further to an IIT Delhi template by Sugeet Sunder.

Feel free to use it, modify it, and share it.
